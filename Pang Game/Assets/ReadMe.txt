I have choosed to implement:

1. Architecture designed with MVC paradigm:
	Looking at the code will look like there is one main class: "GameControllerManager", who represents the Controller, 
	which holds instance of the non monovehaviour class "CoreGameFlow", who represents the model, 
	and hold few classes responsible for the View.
2. Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty +++
3. Custom visuals and shaders ++
4. Custom soundtracks and SFX +
